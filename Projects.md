##### Self-Introducing Chatbot using RAG with Local LLMs  
[*(access code here)*](https://github.com/jiajia-404/rag-llm)
-	Leveraged LLaMA3 with RAG: Implemented the LLaMA3 model locally, using RAG to integrate PDF data (CV and personal statement), for personalized responses.
-	Developed User Interface: Created an interactive web page allowing users to input questions and receive real-time responses.

###### Demo

##### Brain-based Reinforcement Learning for Decision Making
*(Code pending)*

This is my PhD research, focuses on using a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to complete three tasks inspired by insect brains:
- Identify the optimal learning strategy that enhances insect agent survival in hazardous environments with varying memory types.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different synaptic plasticity forms during learning.
- Determine the most efficient decision-making process for foraging using a contextual bandit approach.

##### Python-based Numerical Techniques in Solving Black-Scholes equation 
[*(access code here)*](https://github.com/jiajia-404/JJM_Bachelor_FYP)
- Resolved the Black-Scholes partial differential equation by applying Monte Carlo model and the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

- Implemented Explicit, Implicit and Crankâ€“Nicolson FDM algorithms with Python, applied Numpy to finish decompositions.

- Analyzed the stability and convergency of the models, compared the resulting accuracy and computational cost of the FDM models against the Monte Carlo model.

##### A cute Pusheen cat chatbot based on Andriod 
[*(access code here)*](https://github.com/jiajia-404/Mr.Meow)
- A cute chatbot based on Java and Android Studio, allows both voice and text input, which allows users to chat via text and voice messages and manage chat histories.

- Applied Simsim API, Google Firebase API and Andriod Speech to relize the voice and text conversation.
