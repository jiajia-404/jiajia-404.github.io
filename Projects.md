### [Python-based Numerical Techniques in Solving Black-Scholes equation](https://github.com/jiajia-404/JJM_Bachelor_FYP)
- Resolved the Black-Scholes partial differential equation by applying Monte Carlo model and the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

- Implemented Explicit, Implicit and Crankâ€“Nicolson FDM algorithms with Python, applied Numpy to finish decompositions.

- Analyzed the stability and convergency of the models, compared the resulting accuracy and computational cost of the FDM models against the Monte Carlo model.
