### [Room Cleaning Robot Based on Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/jiajia-404/TydingUpProject)

- Used Deep Neural Network and HSV colour detection into the Computer Vision system and achieved real-time Object detection and classification.

- Achieved the distributed computing of the robot control system based on Robot Operating System, desiend the robot manipulation system includes the control and motion planning of the robot arm, gripper and mobile base.

### [Python-based Numerical Techniques in Solving Black-Scholes equation](https://github.com/jiajia-404/JJM_Bachelor_FYP)
- Resolved the Black-Scholes partial differential equation by applying Monte Carlo model and the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

- Implemented Explicit, Implicit and Crankâ€“Nicolson FDM algorithms with Python, applied Numpy to finish decompositions.

- Analyzed the stability and convergency of the models, compared the resulting accuracy and computational cost of the FDM models against the Monte Carlo model.
