### [Electro-physiology models of cells with spherical geometry with non-conducting centre](https://github.com/vanrossumlab/jiamu_20)

Neurons and other cells use electrical signals for intra- and inter cellular communications. Accurate mathematical models have been developed to describe the spatial-temporal dynamics of the voltage in response to input current. Best known is the cable equation, which describes voltage propagation along the length of a passive cable in response to current injection. However, this model is not appropriate for cells with geometries other than the cylinder. Here we study the flow of electrical currents in cells with a spherical geometry in which only a thin shell close to the surface conducts. Such geometries arise for instance in white adipocytes (fat cells), which are cells constituted by an insulating lipid droplet surrounded by a thin conductive cytoplasm shell, and might also be relevant for some types of spherically shaped peripheral neurons. 

First, we construct a circuit model based on the nature of the passive membrane, and derive the equivalent of the cable equation for spherical geometries. We derive the steady-state solution analytically and show that the shape of the voltage profile depends on a single parameter that describes the electro-tonical compactness. Furthermore, we show that, in contrast to the cable equation, the voltage profile across the cell depends sensitively on the electrode geometry.

Next, we  numerically explore the time-dependent solution to step input currents. In particular, we find that the charging and discharging are much faster than one would expect from the membrane time constant, which is important when one aims to extract fundamental membrane properties from experimental recordings.

Finally, we consider voltage-clamping experiments, often used to measure input current of cells and examine the distortions arising from imperfect space-clamp.

In conclusion, our study yields an equivalent of the cable equation for spherical geometries, which can facilitate further investigations of the electrical signals on cells with spherical structures.

### [Python-based Numerical Techniques in Solving Black-Scholes equation](https://github.com/jiajia-404/JJM_Bachelor_FYP)
- Resolved the Black-Scholes partial differential equation by applying Monte Carlo model and the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

- Implemented Explicit, Implicit and Crankâ€“Nicolson FDM algorithms with Python, applied Numpy to finish decompositions.

- Analyzed the stability and convergency of the models, compared the resulting accuracy and computational cost of the FDM models against the Monte Carlo model.
